At the end of the day this is a fight between the writers and their agents and what will ultimately wind up happening (just my best guess) is packaging fees will go away in their entirety, thereby reducing the cost of making content for the Producers. The Producers have been waiting for this day for more than three decades! \[bctt tweet="Did the guild actually think that the agencies would say, 'Shucks guys you're right maybe we should stop collecting packaging fees?'" username=""\] The WGA should be standing behind their writers and their representation and what they have done is create a civil war within the writer's community and their representation. That to me feels as self-destructive as every other action they have taken since they started with the animation writers in the 80s.
