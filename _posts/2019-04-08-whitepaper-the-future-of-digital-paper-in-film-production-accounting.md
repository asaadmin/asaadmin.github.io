The days of manual document submission and forms processing are over. For over a decade, accounting departments at Fortune 500 companies have been abandoning paper-based methods for collecting and tracking accounting information and turning to technology.

If we (accounting) don't start the conversation now the suits or the payroll service clowns will beat us to it. And I guarantee you, the result will SUCK!

Our whitepaper (20 minute read) defines the scope of the conversation for how we need to implement a digital workflow into the production accounting office. It also sets the standards we should be looking for when adopting software for making the transition.

We also offer a suggestion where we might not need to be shipping so many accountants into a location or hiring unvetted and inexperienced locals by allowing our teams to work remotely from an office in Los Angeles or New York. Where the vast majority of our friends and trusted colleagues live.

Have a look at the paper and join the conversation before the tech-douche bags force us into a system that will frustrate crew and have us training them and subsequently getting none of our other work done.
