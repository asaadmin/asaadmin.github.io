## Read the full article: [The Truth About Casting: It Doesn't Happen in a Hotel Room or Some Sleazy Producer's House](http://wordpress.local/the-truth-about-casting-it-doesnt-happen-in-a-hotel-room-or-some-sleazy-producers-house/)

 Casting does not happen in some douchebag’s house, in a bedroom or in a hotel room. If you encounter this, especially if the guy is in a robe, you are probably about to see the dick of the scumbag in the robe. What I like to call a “dick-out” - *REALLY* aren't we past that. It disgust me the way some idiots choose to behave, but you have the choice to walkaway. Just point and laugh at their little pecker and go home. You might even hear some lame excuse about cold water and shrinkage as you walk away. Use my list of clues in this video to recognize when an audition is really just a hookup. And if you find yourself in a harassing situation, report the douchebag - they deserve to have the light shined on their sleazy behavior and an SVU detective track them down. \[content\_upgrade cu\_id="629"\]**Free download: 20 Quick Tips for a Better Audition**\[content\_upgrade\_button\]Click Here\[/content\_upgrade\_button\]\[/content\_upgrade\] Brand/Design and Editorial by - [www.stephenhens.com](http://www.stephenhens.com) / [www.earnestlydesigned.com](http://www.earnestlydesigned.com) Main Title Music: “The Sky Falls" Written by Mick Rhodes and Performed by Human Therapy - [www.mickrhodes.com](http://www.mickrhodes.com)
